            <p><br>Ontario Scholars are high school graduates in the Canadian province of Ontario who attain an average of 80% or greater in their six best Grade 12 courses.
                The award is granted by the Ontario Ministry of Education, and consists of a certificate from the Minister of Education that is usually presented to students at their graduation ceremony. The award and its certificate are standardized by the Ministry of Education; however, some schools choose internally to have special recognition of Ontario Scholars above and beyond this. The award is distinct from other academic acknowledgements such as an Honour Roll.</p>
